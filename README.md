# Introduction

Based on 48 breeds of cats, this app shows a range of breeds that your feline friend lies in.
Version one gives a general overview with values representing the dominant breed.

## How it works

Post a link of your cat's photo on the input field. Upon submission of link, breed matches are generated with the top-most being the most predominant.
